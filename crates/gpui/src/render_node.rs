//! Retained render nodes for incremental rendering.
//!
//! This module defines the `RenderNode` trait and associated types for the
//! retained layer of GPUI's two-layer rendering architecture. RenderNodes
//! persist in the fiber tree and own all element-specific state and caches.
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! Elements (descriptors) are ephemeral - created each frame via `render()`.
//! RenderNodes are persistent - they live in the fiber tree and are updated
//! by descriptors during reconciliation.
//!
//! This separation allows:
//! - O(changed) incremental rendering via dirty tracking
//! - State persistence (scroll position, hover state, etc.) across frames
//! - Generic fiber traversal without element-type knowledge
